# UserService
The other project will be an application that is the client of the first as well as the Accounts service(https://spring.io/blog/2015/07/14/microservices-with-spring) from the sample code. It supports
“Signing on” – all this requires is the user entering one of the account numbers that already exists.
This requires querying the Accounts service
Once this is done, then the following are allowed:
Displaying the contents of the forum, thread-by-thread
Creating a thread – it has a subject and body
Add a post – it has the text of a body and is either added to a thread or replies to another post
